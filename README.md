# FederiMed: Concept Overview

**FederiMed** is an innovative platform that focuses on providing actionable clinical insights by leveraging a global network of healthcare professionals and cutting-edge federated learning techniques, all while ensuring patient privacy and data security.

### The Problem
When you visit your primary care doctor with unique symptoms, they might suggest a conservative treatment plan with medications, but this could only delay the underlying condition. Meanwhile, other doctors around the world may have encountered similar cases and provided effective treatments. Unfortunately, this valuable clinical knowledge is siloed in each hospital's database, making it difficult for doctors to benefit from the collective insights of their global peers.

If you're fortunate enough to survive the initial treatment, you might return to primary care with new insights. This time, however, your doctor could offer a more effective treatment plan based on what has worked for other patients with similar symptoms or medical histories, thanks to the knowledge shared globally through **FederiMed**.

### Our Solution
**FederiMed** focuses on actionable clinical insights by connecting doctors globally and creating a centralized federated learning model. We extract and aggregate anonymized data from hospitals and use it to fine-tune a global Large Language Model (LLM) for enhanced decision-making.

- **Federated Learning**: Instead of sharing sensitive patient data, local models are trained at hospitals, and only the model weights are sent to the global server. This preserves patient privacy while enabling cross-institutional collaboration to improve the global model.
  
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Using federated fine-tuning, patient data remains securely within each hospital, ensuring compliance with privacy laws like HIPAA and GDPR while mitigating the risk of data breaches.

### The Process
1. Doctors across hospitals train local models using their anonymized patient data.
2. Instead of sharing raw data, hospitals share only model weights with the global server.
3. The global server aggregates updates from hospitals and fine-tunes the global model, incorporating a wide variety of clinical scenarios.
4. Doctors can then query the global model for actionable insights, such as tailored treatment plans based on similar patient histories and symptoms.

### Current Demo
- **Synthetic Data**: We generated synthetic patient data using [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), simulating 100 patients to test the system.
- **Federated Learning Framework**: We employed [**FLWR**](https://github.com/adap/flower), a Python-based federated learning framework, to facilitate the collaboration and model training.
- **Current Status**: The platform is currently operational with a demo setup supporting 1-2 clients, showcasing the potential of federated learning in healthcare.

By unlocking the power of federated learning, **FederiMed** empowers doctors to access actionable, data-driven insights and make more informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes while safeguarding privacy.
