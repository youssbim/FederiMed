# FederiMed: Concept Overview

**FederiMed** aims to revolutionize healthcare decision-making by creating a global network of healthcare professionals who share anonymized insights without compromising patient privacy.

### The Problem
Imagine you visit your primary care doctor with a set of symptoms they've never encountered before. Their response may be to suggest a slow-paced treatment plan with some medications, which could just delay the underlying issue. Meanwhile, other doctors around the world may have encountered similar cases and already issued successful treatments. Unfortunately, this valuable information remains isolated in each hospital's database.

### Our Solution
**FederiMed** solves this problem by connecting doctors globally and creating a centralized federated learning model. We extract and aggregate anonymized data from hospitals and use it to fine-tune a global Large Language Model (LLM). 

- **Federated Learning**: Instead of sharing raw patient data, we share only the model weights from each local hospitalâ€™s model. These updates are sent to a central server, which aggregates them and fine-tunes the global model. This allows us to learn from a broad range of cases while maintaining patient privacy.

- **Privacy-Preserving**: By using federated fine-tuning, patient data never leaves the hospital. This ensures compliance with privacy laws like HIPAA and GDPR, and prevents the risk of data breaches.

### The Process
1. Doctors across hospitals train local models using their patient datasets.
2. Instead of sharing raw data, hospitals share only the model weights to the global server.
3. The global server aggregates the updates, improving the global model with insights from all participating hospitals.
4. Doctors can access the global model to query for insights, such as treatments for specific symptoms or conditions.

This system enables doctors to leverage the collective knowledge of healthcare professionals worldwide, helping them provide better, data-driven treatments for their patients.
